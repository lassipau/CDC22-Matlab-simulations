# Controller design and simulation for one and two-dimensional heat equations

These codes contain the Matlab simulations in the manuscript "On robust regulation of PDEs: from abstract methods to PDE controllers" by Lassi Paunonen and Jukka-Pekka Humaloja, submitted to the Proceedings of the 61st IEEE Con- ference on Decision and Control, 2022.

## Requirements

The codes require the free RORPack Matlab library [https://github.com/lassipau/rorpack-matlab/](https://github.com/lassipau/rorpack-matlab/). In addition, the one-dimensional example requires the free
Chebfun Matlab library [https://www.chebfun.org/](https://www.chebfun.org/). The installation of these libraries can be done by downloading them and adding their directories and subdirectories to the Matlab PATH.

## Usage

The simulations are completed by executing the main files "Heat2D_CDC22.m" and "Heat1D_CDC22.m".
